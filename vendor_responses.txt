Subject: Response to Highland Health Authority MyHealth Project RFI – Epic EHR Solution 
Dear MyHealth Procurement Team, 
Thank you for the opportunity to respond to the Highland Health Authority's (HHA) Request for Information (RFI) for the MyHealth Project. As a global leader in electronic health record (EHR) solutions, Epic Systems Corporation is excited about the potential to partner with HHA in transforming its paper-based system into a modern, integrated platform that aligns with your vision of "The best health and care for everyone, everywhere, every time." Our Epic EHR platform has empowered over 250 healthcare organizations worldwide, including large regional authorities in Canada, to deliver patient-centered care across diverse urban, rural, and remote settings. We appreciate HHA's commitment to the CARE principles and are eager to demonstrate how Epic supports courage in innovation, aspiration for quality, respect for individuals, and empathy in care delivery. Epic's response is structured to address the key areas outlined in the RFI: alignment with Canada Health Infoway's Benefits Evaluation Framework, product features, compliance with PHIPA, implementation and support, interoperability, data security, pricing, and integration with existing systems. We have extensive experience with large-scale implementations, such as our successful deployments at University Health Network (UHN) in Ontario and Alberta Health Services, serving populations exceeding 1 million with seamless regional integration. 
1.	Alignment with Canada Health Infoway's Benefits Evaluation Framework
Epic EHR is designed to drive measurable improvements in clinical outcomes, safety, and efficiency, directly supporting Infoway's framework (Canada Health Infoway, 2012a; 2012b). Our platform reduces medication errors by up to 50% through embedded clinical decision support tools, including real-time alerts for drug interactions and evidence-based care pathways tailored to chronic disease management—critical for HHA's diverse population. Efficiency gains include streamlined workflows that cut documentation time by 30%, enabling your 18,000 staff to focus on patient care. For safety, Epic's longitudinal patient record eliminates illegible paper entries, reducing adverse events and supporting KPIs like reduced readmissions and duplicate tests. We track these through built-in analytics, aligning with Infoway's emphasis on data-driven evaluation. 
2.	Product Features and Customization
Epic offers a comprehensive, modular EHR suite with features optimized for HHA's multi-site needs: 
•	Clinical Decision Support: AI-powered tools for personalized care pathways, integrated with SNOMED CT, ICD-10-CA, CCI, and LOINC standards. 
•	Patient Engagement: MyChart patient portal (iOS/Android app) enables secure access to records, virtual care, and collaborative decision-making, boosting engagement KPIs. 
•	Workflow Redesign and Training: Customizable training plans for 18,000 users, including role-based simulations and ongoing clinician engagement via user forums. We provide resources like e-learning modules and on-site facilitators, requiring HHA to allocate 20-40 hours per staff for initial training. 
•	Change Management: Phased adoption strategies with stakeholder workshops to foster buy-in, drawing from our Ontario implementations.
Customization is flexible via low-code tools, allowing adaptation to HHA's specialized programs without disrupting core functionality. 
3.	Compliance with PHIPA and Data Security Protocols
Epic is fully compliant with PHIPA, PIPEDA, FIPPA, and Infoway's Privacy and Security Framework (Canada Health Infoway, 2012c). Our HITRUST-certified platform employs role-based access controls, end-to-end encryption, and comprehensive audit trails to safeguard PHI. In Canadian deployments, we conduct PHIPA-specific gap analyses and support provincial reporting requirements. Data security features include multi-factor authentication, anomaly detection AI, and zero-trust architecture, ensuring ≥99.9% uptime and HIPAA-equivalent protections. 
4.	Implementation, Migration, and Support
With over 55 years of experience, Epic has implemented in 20+ Canadian sites, including phased rollouts for geographically dispersed authorities. For MyHealth: 
•	Pre-Implementation (Oct 2025–Mar 2026): Collaborative readiness assessments, data migration planning from paper (using OCR scanning and validation), and infrastructure audits. We handle 80% of migration, requiring HHA to provide legacy data exports. 
•	Go-Live (Apr–Oct 2026): Pilot in one clinic, followed by regional rollout with downtime protocols (e.g., redundant servers, offline mobile apps) and disaster recovery (RTO <4 hours). 
•	Stabilization/Optimization (Nov 2026–Oct 2027): Hypercare support with dedicated teams, workflow refinements based on feedback. 
•	Long-Term: 24/7 support via Oracle Health Learning Framework, with annual updates for national integration (e.g., PrescribeIT).
Post-implementation, we offer continuous clinician engagement through user groups and predictive analytics for system health. 
5.	Interoperability and Integration
Epic excels in interoperability via Care Everywhere, exchanging 20M+ records daily across EHRs (HL7 v2/v3, FHIR APIs). We integrate seamlessly with lab (LOINC), pharmacy, and imaging systems, supporting real-time data exchange for HHA's facilities. In Canada, we've enabled bi-directional sharing with non-Epic systems at UHN, aligning with Infoway's standards (Canada Health Infoway, 2020). Scalability accommodates HHA's growth, with cloud-native deployment for remote access. 
6.	Pricing Overview
Epic's pricing is subscription-based, tailored to HHA's scale: 
•	Licensing/Implementation: $25M–$35M (includes customization, migration, and Phase 1 training). 
•	Annual Maintenance/Support: $5M–$7M (18% of initial cost, covering updates and 24/7 helpdesk). 
•	Additional: Training $2,000/user average; optional modules $1M–$3M.
Total 10-year TCO: $80M–$100M, with ROI via 20-30% efficiency gains (Evans, 2016). Detailed quotes available post-RFI.
Epic is committed to HHA's success and welcomes discussions to refine this proposal. We look forward to advancing your MyHealth vision. Sincerely,
Dr. Sarah Thompson
Vice President, Canadian Operations
