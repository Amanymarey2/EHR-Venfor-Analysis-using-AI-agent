RFI Basics

The Highland Health Authority is a vast organization which provides a variety of health services to over 775,000 people in the Highland region of British Columbia. By providing a full spectrum of hospitals, clinics, care centres, etc., the organization aims to improve the patient and provider experience through technology-driven care delivery. With over 18,000 professionals on staff, the HHA provides a comprehensive range of short-term and long-term care services, as well as specialized programs tailored to address the region’s complex and diverse population. Despite socioeconomic status and geographical location, populations from urban, rural and even remote areas all receive impartial access to the HHA’s health services. The HHA collaborates with local organizations, provincial ministries and academic institutions to advance evidence-based health solutions, health equity and public health services. 

This organization’s vision is to provide "The best health and care for everyone, everywhere, every time." Guided by the CARE acronym–Courage: to do the right thing, change, innovate and grow; Aspire: to the highest degree of quality and safety; Respect: to value each individual and bring trust to every relationship; Empathy to give the kind of care we would want for our loved ones–the HHA is continually striving for excellence in quality, innovation, and safety. The Highland Health Authority is creating a sustainable health system that benefits patients and providers now and in the future.  

The purpose of this request for information (RFI) is to compile information on potential vendors in regard to current options for electronic health record (EHR) solutions which might be suitable for the HHA’s MyHealth Project. This project aims to transform HHA’s current paper-based system to a more modern electronic system for the entire region that guarantees the most effective use of medical resources, increases inter-facility communication and raises the standards for patient care and safety.  

Along with understanding a vendor’s previous experience with large-scale healthcare implementations, the possibility of customization and post-implementation support services, the HHA wants to know how well they are in compliance with Canadian health data standards (PHIPA).The HHA hopes to learn more about the vendor’s capabilities in regards to compliance with PHIPA as well as product features, implementation, interoperability, data security and protocols and overall pricing through this RFI. Additionally, this RFI will assist in the assessment of how well vendors are prepared to integrate the EHR system with existing health systems such as laboratory information systems, pharmacy management systems and diagnostic imaging systems. The goal is to guarantee the effortless exchange of information across all care facilities within the Highland region. 

Overall, the information that is gathered will allow the HHA to produce a formal Request for Proposal (RFP), which will then allow the organization to procure and select an EHR system which best aligns with its vision and values. This procedure assists the HHA in achieving its long-term goal of creating a linked, data-driven healthcare system which can improve patient and provider care. 
Project Overview
            
In order to address the limitations of its current paper-based records system, Highland Health Authority (HHA) is launching the MyHealth Project, a multi-year, region-wide Electronic Health Record (EHR) transformation initiative. The goal is to implement a single, integrated, longitudinal health record across all HHA sites and programs to improve quality, safety, and continuity of care. MyHealth will enhance patient safety by eliminating illegible or incomplete records, improve communication across care settings, streamline workflows, and reduce redundancy. The system will also support clinical decision-making with built-in tools and improve both patient and provider satisfaction by facilitating seamless care transitions and reducing administrative burdens.

To evaluate the project’s success, HHA will track Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) over a 6–18-month period post-go-live. These KPIs include reductions in medication errors and adverse events, improved timeliness and accuracy of data sharing, cost savings from eliminating inefficiencies, high rates of staff adoption and satisfaction, and enhanced patient engagement. These KPIs align with national best practices outlined by Canada Health Infoway (2012a).

For a more comprehensive evaluation, HHA will also monitor additional indicators. These include clinical metrics such as reduced hospital readmission rates, lower average inpatient length of stay, fewer duplicate tests, and improved chronic disease outcomes. Staff adoption parameters will include documentation time, training completion rates, and help desk ticket volumes. Technical metrics will track system uptime (target ≥ 99.9%), response time, and data latency. Meanwhile, patient-focused KPIs will assess portal use, satisfaction with digital access, and virtual care uptake. Indicators for measuring compliance will include successful data exchange rates, role-based access control, and audit trail effectiveness (Canada Health Infoway, 2012b; 2012c; 2017; 2020).

MyHealth will use national data standards such as SNOMED CT for clinical terminology, ICD-10-CA for diagnoses, CCI for procedures, and LOINC for lab results. Messaging protocols like HL7 v2/v3 and FHIR will enable secure, real-time communication across systems (Canada Health Infoway, 2020). The system will also comply with Infoway’s Privacy and Security Framework, aligning with legislation such as FIPPA and PIPEDA (Canada Health Infoway, 2012c), and will support digital services like patient portals and virtual care (Canada Health Infoway, 2017).

The MyHealth implementation will follow a five-phase timeline with defined milestones:
1.	Pre-Implementation Phase (October 2025 – March 2026): Any questions regarding this RFI and/or Highland Health Authority and its goals, evaluation criteria and compliance shall be submitted by the potential vendor before Friday, October 10, 2025, following the instructions outlined below in this document. RFI submissions are due by October 24, 2025, with vendor selection and contract finalization by early 2026. This phase focuses on stakeholder engagement, change management, and training development.
2.	Implementation & Go-Live Phase (April 2026 – October 2026): Pilot testing will begin in April 2026, with phased go-live starting July 2026 and full rollout across all HHA sites by October 2026. KPIs during this phase will focus on training completion, initial user adoption, and early workflow impact.
3.	Stabilization Phase (November 2026 – April 2027): This period will involve system refinements based on user feedback, reduced IT support demand, and the resolution of technical issues.
4.	Optimization Phase (May 2027 – October 2027): During this phase, HHA will assess long-term outcomes, including cost savings, reduced adverse events, and improved care coordination.
5.	Long-Term Evaluation & National Integration (Post-October 2027): HHA will align the system with national initiatives like PrescribeIT and Access Health, expand cross-jurisdictional data sharing, and continuously measure success using Infoway’s Benefits Evaluation Framework (Canada Health Infoway, 2012d).

With its standards-based approach and phased rollout, MyHealth positions HHA as a leader in digital health innovation, delivering improved outcomes for patients, providers, and the health system overall.



 
Information Requested from Suppliers
For the MyHealth project, HHA requests that vendors provide comprehensive information about their EHR solutions, with particular emphasis on how their systems support pre-implementation planning, organizational readiness, and staff training. Vendors are expected to explain in detail the infrastructure requirements and migration strategies from paper to digital records. They must also explain the approach to ensuring system reliability during the transition. They should also highlight compliance with Canadian privacy and security standards, including alignment with federal and provincial requirements, and describe how their solution integrates with existing information systems at both the provincial and national level. Particular attention should be paid to interoperability standards, the adaptability of the system to different clinical environments, user interface design, and scalability across multiple facilities. As MyHealth represents a transformational initiative, it is essential that the proposed solutions demonstrate not only technical capacity but also the ability to support safe, efficient, and patient-centered care across the entire Highland region (Canada Health Infoway, 2022). 
MyHealth Team requests vendors to respond to some questions that will guide the assessment process. Suppliers will begin by describing how their systems match up with Canada Health Infoway's benefits evaluation framework for improving clinical results, safety, and efficiency. They must also describe how user training plans, workflow redesign plans, and change management plans will support adoption by 18,000 staff, and how to engage clinicians continuously and the resources HHA will need to make available during planning and implementation. During go-live, vendors are asked to provide information regarding downtime processes, system restore processes, and disaster recovery planning so that patient safety is not compromised at any point. In addition, they should also explain how their solution ensures continuity of care in acute, community, and residential settings at launch date. Following deployment, vendors must indicate how their system supports patient engagement, i.e., secure patient portals, access to health information, and decision-making in collaboration, and outline the resources required from HHA for ongoing monitoring and evaluation to promote long-term success and adherence to organizational goals (CIHI, 2023). 
All vendor submissions must be provided electronically in PDF or Word format and emailed to myhealth.procurement@hha.ca by Friday, October 24, 2025 at 5:00 PM Eastern Time. Any questions for clarification must be submitted in writing no later than Friday, October 11, 2025 to the final submission deadline, and all communications must follow HHA’s procurement protocols to guarantee fairness and transparency. Queries regarding this RFI should be directed to the MyHealth procurement team at myhealth.procurement@hha.ca with the subject line “MyHealth RFI Inquiry.” Vendors should note that late or incomplete submissions will not be considered. Overall, this process will allow HHA to carefully compare vendor responses and identify the solution that best supports long-term regional goals of improving quality, consistency, and efficiency of care delivery (Government of Canada, 2021; Digital Health Canada, 2022). 
Bonus Section
Three vendors are prospective applicants for HHA’s MyHealth project Request for RFI: Epic Systems Corporation, Cerner Corporation (now Oracle Cerner), and MEDITECH. These vendors were chosen due to their previous experience of developing extensive electronic health record (EHR) systems, suitability with HHA's objectives of increased quality and safety, and system integration in multi-aspect healthcare environments.
Epic Systems Corp is one of the most prevalent EHR systems of North America. It boasts good interoperability and a broad set of functionalities in its feature base, such as better clinical decision support, care pathways embedded, and patient portals that are robust (Evans, 2016). Epic has proved itself able to manage huge geographically distributed health systems, and thus is an ideal fit for HHA's vision of a single patient record following patients between hospitals, clinics, and community environments. Its emphasis on unbroken information sharing will solve specifically HHA's current issues with ineffective communication and continuity of care .
Cerner Corporation (Oracle Cerner) is one of the EHR industry giants known for scalability and flexibility in various healthcare settings. Cerner possesses robust order entry and clinical decision support capabilities that have been proven to cut down on prescription errors and enhance patient safety (HealthIT.gov, 2022). This is specifically applicable to HHA, where it sees thousands of illegible prescriptions each year resulting in dangerous drug interactions. Cerner also has robust analytics and reporting capability, which aligns with HHA's objectives for expanded quality measurement and resource utilization. Cerner's presence in Canada would also enable HHA to tap local support for implementation and ongoing system maintenance. 
MEDITECH has considerable experience serving hospitals, clinics, and health regional agencies on a cost-effective, user-friendly, and interoperable platform (Adler-Milstein & Huckman, 2013). MEDITECH's contemporary platform, Expanse, is cloud- and mobile-deployed and thus is incredibly well-suited to the varied infrastructure of HHA centers. Its ability to integrate small hospitals and community-based facilities with large healthcare organizations positions it well for the requirements of HHA. Both at the large scale and at the level of operations within communities, MEDITECH offers an affordable but complete solution for the deployment of EHR. 
In conclusion, Epic, Cerner, and MEDITECH are the most appropriate vendors HHA should partner with at the RFI level. The three vendors are mature, have state-of-the-art functionalities, and are adapting to interoperability, all of which directly translate to HHA's mission of enhancing patient safety, communication, and effectiveness across its network. Partnering with the vendors will prepare HHA to obtain in-depth, relevant, and competitive responses that will lead the MyHealth team towards successful procurement.
